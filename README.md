# PathCon

PathCon implementation by pytorch for personal practice.

**Running the Code**

$ python main.py --cuda  
$ python main.py --cuda --max_path_len=3 --neighbor_agg=concat 

**Required packages**

The code has been tested running under Python 3.10.4, with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies):

torch == 1.12.0  
cuda == 11.3  
numpy == 1.22.3  
scipy == 1.7.3  
sklearn == 1.1.1

This code is just a copy of the code below to study.
I will revise or change something for research one day.
